AIR PRESSURE SYSTEM is a critical component of a heavy duty vehicle that uses compressed air to force a piston to provide pressure to the break pads, slowing the vehicle down. APS is preferred over hydraulic because of easy availability of natural air.

This is a classification problem in which the affirmative class indicates that the failure was caused by a certain component of the APS while the negative class indicates that the failure was caused by something else.

SOLUTION PROPOSED
In this project the system in focus is APS, which generates pressurised air that is utilized in various functions in a truck such as braking and gear changes. The datasets positive class corresponds to componenet failures for the specific component of the APS sysytem. The negative class corresponds to trucks with fai;ures for components not related to APS.
The problem is to reduce the cost due to unnecessary repairs. So it is required to minimize the False predictions.
